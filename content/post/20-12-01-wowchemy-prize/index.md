GAINESVILLE, Fla. – The award is presented by the Teaching & Learning Center at Warrington to recognize outstanding graduate student teaching and instructional innovation. The recipient for each semester is selected by the Warrington Teaching Committee.

Cooper is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Warrington’s Department of Management. His research focuses on a variety of topics including incivility, cognition and psychological resilience. Most recently, he’s been focused on how organizations can help individuals cope with workplace rudeness. He received his master’s in social-organizational psychology from Bar-Ilan University in Israel and his bachelor’s degree in psychology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.

“I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Warrington College of Business for the award,” Cooper said. “Throughout my time at the department of management, I’ve considered myself fortunate to receive an incredible amount of support and feedback from my advisor Prof. Amir Erez and fellow Ph.D. students. The open and friendly exchange of ideas in our department has been invaluable in helping me develop my teaching philosophy.”

Cooper taught Human Resource Management in the fall 2018 semester. The course is designed to provide students with an overview of human resource management (HRM).

“If an organization wants good people, it must practice good HRM,” Cooper said. “As part of the course, students were required to combine theories with practices, which culminated in a final group project that asked them to apply their understanding of HRM practices by making recommendations about good HR policies for a job of their choice.”
