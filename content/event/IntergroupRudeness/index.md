Rudeness, a pervasive form of interpersonal incivility, is on the rise. Everyday manifestations of rudeness, such as social rejection and verbal insults, are omnipresent in politics, across work organizations, in our communities, and on social media. Research suggests that even mild (i.e., low-intensity) manifestations of rudeness exert powerful effects. For example, exposure to rudeness at work has been linked to depression, stress, and diminished cognitive and behavioral performance. Moreover, rudeness tends to be “contagious”: Its effects ripple to additional victims beyond the immediate target of the rude behavior. 

Although previous research has made important strides by demonstrating that exposure to rudeness harms its direct targets, its witnesses, as well as uninvolved third parties, systematic research on the question “To whom rudeness’ effects spread?” is notably missing. We know that witnesses of rudeness become the carriers of its harmful consequences but whom do witnesses of rudeness typically hurt? Nearly all of the existing research on rudeness has used nonspecific targets in exploring rudeness’ harmful downstream consequences. Therefore, little is known about the epidemiology of rudeness—that is, how its harmful consequences are distributed in defined populations. 

Here we illuminate the epidemiology of rudeness by exploring the idea that witnesses of rudeness are particularly likely to harm out-group targets. Thus, we propose, and empirically demonstrate, that the natural human tendency to divide the social realm into “us” and “them” facilitates people’s tendency to choose out-group members as the targets for rudeness’ downstream consequences. Put differently, exposure to rudeness exacerbates intergroup bias, leading witnesses of rudeness to harm out-group members both passively and actively. We explored this proposition in three experiments.
