While people across the world value honesty, it is undeniable that it can sometimes pay to be dishonest. This tension leads people to engage in myriad complex behaviors that stretch the boundaries of honesty. Such behaviors include strategically avoiding information, dodging questions, omitting information, and making true but misleading statements. Though not lies per se, these are nonetheless deviations from honesty that have serious interpersonal, organizational, and societal costs. By completing a systematic review of honesty in the organizational literature, we aim to organize what we know and motivate researchers to think expansively and holistically about the topic. Our review highlights how honesty encompasses more than the absence of liesâ€”it has relational elements (e.g., fostering an accurate understanding in others through what we disclose and how we communicate) and intellectual elements (e.g., evaluating information for accuracy, searching for accurate information, and updating our beliefs accordingly). By acknowledging that honesty is not limited to the moment when a person utters a clear lie or a full truth, and that there are multiple stages to enacting honesty, we emphasize the shared responsibility that all parties involved in communication have for seeking out and communicating truthful information.

We hope that by developing a more complete view of honest behavior, our work can alter the trajectory of the field and inspire scholars to think expansively and holistically about the topic and expand our understanding of the important role of honesty in the workplace.
