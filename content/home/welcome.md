I am an experienced quantitative organizational researcher with 8+ years of experience, primarily focused on issues that affect how individuals and groups perceive, process and effectively navigate challenging interpersonal conversations. My interests lie in experimental research design, data analysis, quantitative methods, with the goal of promoting adaptive coping in the face of organizational adversity and a more resilient workforce. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as an organizational consultant for two years in Israel serving clients in the high-tech, healthcare, auto and financial industries.
